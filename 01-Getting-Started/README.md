### What is a Database?
> A Database is a collection of data stored in a format that can easily be accessed. 

In order to manage databases we use DBMS (Database management system).  
User <-> DBMS <-> DB

DBMS are classified into 2 categories:
1. Relational (RDBMS) -  
    Data is stored in tables that are related to each other.  
    SQL is the language that we use to query and manage this Relational DB.  
    Some of the most popular RDBMSs are - 
    1. MySQL
    2. SQL Server
    3. Oracle
    4. PostgreSQL  
    There are many relational DBMS systems out there. Each has their own flavour of SQL but, all these SQL are based on a standard SQL specification. 
2. Non-Relational (NoSQL) - 
    Data is not stored in tables. NoSQL doesn't understand SQL. They have their own query language.

All of the RDBMS uses the standard SQL with some of their added tweaks.  
SQL (Structured Query Language) = SQUEL (Structured Query English Language).

### Install MySQL on Mac
- Download the MySQL Server from [MySQL Server](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/) 
- Download the MySQL Workbench (GUI tool to connect to the server) from [MySQL Workbench](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/)

For Windows - We only need to download and install - MySQL Installer. It will install all of the required tools

After installing the tools. Open SQL Workbench. It should have a connection already created named - Local Instance.

### Create the DBs
Download the ZIP file from [sql-course](https://bit.ly/3rvtqdO)  
Open the create-databases.sql file in the SQL Workbench and execute to create all the DBs (Yellow thunder icon to execute)
