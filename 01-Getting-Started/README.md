### What is a Database?
> A Database is a collection of data stored in a format that can easily be accessed. 

In order to manage databases we use DBMS (Database management system).  
US <-> DBMS <-> DB

DBMS are classified into 2 categories:
1. Relational (RDBMS) -  
    Data is stored in tables that are related to each other.  
    SQL is the language that we use to query and manage this DB.  
    Some of the most popular RDBMSs are - 
    1. MySQL
    2. SQL Server
    3. Oracle & many more  
2. Non-Relational (NoSQL) - 
    NoSQL doesn't understand SQL. They have their own query language.

All of the RDBMS uses the standard SQL with some of their added tweaks.  
SQL (Structured Query Language) = SQUEL (Structured Query English Language).

### Installing MySQL on Mac

### Creating the DBs
Import the SQL script and run it.  
Each DB has 4 objects -
1. Tables
2. Views - Virtual tables based on the result-set of an SQL statement. 
3. Stored Procedure
4. Functions
